The f2f project is a talking-stick-like deliberation system that consists of 8 uniquely shaped cards, each representing meaning, and fosters rapid communication, clear comprehension and compassion for personal and group processes. For an example of how to use the system, check out the video at <https://ushin.net/movie/u4u_mockup_demo.mp4>.
